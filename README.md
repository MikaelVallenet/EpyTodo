# EpyTodo

## Warning :warning:

I want to specify that for this project, \
I was a beginner in programming.\
Moreover, I had never used JavaScript,\
Despite this, I got 21/22 in the correction.
 
## Description :sunrise_over_mountains:

The project idea is to build a Todo List. \
Thanks to it, you’ll be able to handle all the tasks you need to do easily! \
We will mainly focus on the “backend” side of the project,\
but feel free to show us what you can by building a “frontend” to your project as a bonus.\
Within this project, you’ll have to develop:\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. your MySQL database.\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. A web server using Node.js


Here is the architecture I set up for the project :

We also made a SQL script to create the database quickly :

You can use curl to perform your queries afterwards \
